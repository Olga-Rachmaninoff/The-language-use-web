# The language use web
Şexbizinî-Kurdish: The Language Use Web explores the communicative connection between the community languages and the agents, the domains and the media of communication.

# About the project

The Language Use Web illustrates how speakers of Şexbizinî-Kurdish navigate their multilingual daily lives.  
The term 'Șexbizinî' refers to a Western Iranian tribal confederation and its language. The main current settlement areas of Şexbizinî Kurds are Central Anatolia and the Turkish Black Sea coast. However, there are also villages in eastern Turkey, western Iran and northern Iraq where Şexbizinî is spoken, or where people identify with the community even if they do not actively speak the language. Additionally, there is a growing diaspora living in many European cities. Unlike Kurmanji-Kurdish, Șexbizinî is a language that has not been codified, but has been transmitted exclusively orally. This may explain why it has largely escaped the attention of linguists until now. At the same time, the number of speakers is decreasing rapidly.  As with most small linguistic communities, daily communication for a Şexbizinî speaker is multilingual. Their transnational lifestyle also contributes to this multilingualism.  
Through the Language Use Web, we propose an interactive visualisation of the various communicative acts in the linguistic lives of speakers of an endangered language. The Language Use Web explores the communicative connection between the community languages and the agents, the domains and the media of communication: 

## Community Languages
The following languages are central constituents in the transnational life of a Șexbizinî-speaker (other languages can be one of the many minority languages of Turkey, national or minority languages of the country of immigration and languages acquired via the school system in Turkey or in the diaspora.):  

Șexbizinî  
Kurmanji  
German  
French  
Turkish  
other  

## Agents, domains and transmitter of communication
**Speakers of Șexbizinî as agents of communication**: speakers are shown as nodes in this visualisation. A speaker of Șexbizinî is defined as a person having Șexbizinî in his/her linguistic repertoire regardless the level of competence or the quantity of use. That means that the person may speak Șexbizinî at a mother tongue level or only know basic vocabulary or a few phrases.  
**Interlocutors as agents of communication**: Every speaker was asked about his preferred language when talking to relatives and people of the neighbourhood. These interlocutors are also represented as nodes in the multilingual communication web:  

partner  
children  
mother  
father  
siblings  
friends  
relatives  
neighbours  

**Situations as domains of communication**: The speakers were asked about their language choice in different domains with rising degrees of publicity ranging from talking to their beloved ones to talking to teachers or policemen. The following situations are represented as nodes:  

dreaming  
counting  
praying  
shouting at children  
explanations to children  
cursing  
joking  
private topics  
discussing  
singing, playing  
talking to a beloved person  
at the doctor  
at the police, at the bank  
at court  
with teachers at school  
asking for directions  
with customers  
shopping  
at the restaurant  
at weddings  
at funerals  
at religious ceremonies  

**Media as transmitter of communication**: Finally, we gathered the usage of language in various media as linguistic transmitters. We covered traditional media such as books, letters and diaries as well as television, additionally we asked about language use in social media. The following media are represented as nodes:  

facebook  
twitter (X)  
Instagram  
whatsapp, telegram  
tiktok  
discord  
youtube  
email  
sms  
books  
letters  
poems  
diaries  
shopping lists  
stories  
jokes  
songs  
other
